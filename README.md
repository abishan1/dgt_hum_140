"Data and viz of interest"
1. An article that interests me is "Ethical Considerations in Data Science and AI", which ties ethics to the use of AI. This article interests me because it is a major topic in today's society; we must be responsible about the training of AI models and how they are used. For example, stable diffusion models can be used to spread misinformation, so there must be a way to distinguish between real and fake information.

2. I like this data visualization because it provides a clear correlation between GDP and life expectancy in countries around the world. By looking at the data, we get a clear and concise understanding of how life expectancy goes up with higher GDPs, highlighting a grave problem that can be gradually mitigated by contributing to the GDPs of other countries. 


"Ideas for data to investigate"
* Housing Injustice: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/homeownership-racial-segregation-and-policies-for-racial-wealth-equity/
* Workplace Injuries and Labor Laws: https://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm

"Ideas from curated datasets & project lists"
1. Dataset Name: "Deaths in US jails"
* This data is collected by Reuters to publicize the deaths that occur in jails between 2008 and 2019. This data would otherwise not be public; Reuters sent out 1,500+ requests to access this data, which state governments are required to respond to. Coding can help understand trends in the data, like which states have the most deaths, or how deaths have increased/decreased over time.

2. Dataset Name: "Sources of income, and expenditures, for college athletics"
* This data shows the total expenses in college athletics, and the different portions of those expenditures. Coding can help understand which portions of the expenditures can be reduced to increase the other portions. It can also help analyze how expenditures have increased/decreased over time.
